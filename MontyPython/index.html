		<h2>It's only a model</h2>
		<p>We're Knights of the Round Table.  We dance whene'er we're able.  We do routines and chorus scenes with footwork impeccable.  We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.  We're Knights of the Round Table.  Our shows are formidable, but many times we're given rhymes that are quite unsingable.  We're opera mad in Camelot.  We sing from the diaphragm a lot.</p>
